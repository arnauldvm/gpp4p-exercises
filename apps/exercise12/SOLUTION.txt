Step 0
------

$ ./compile.sh
$ ./generate.sh
$ ./run.sh

-> profile00

1Â°/ Fixing the test harness

Step 0.1
--------

profile00 -> Too much reads

The time spent reading the data from file is proportionally too big.
Datasets are too small, because of overridden size in generate.sh
=> Multiply size by 10 (add a '0')

$ ./generate.sh
$ ./run.sh

-> profile01

Step 0.2
--------

profile01 -> Still too much reads, we don't see well what's happening in the testDataset method

This is because of testDataset method reading data one at a time, and during the profiling.
=> Read it at once before the test loop

-> profile02
   . we now have much more details
   . the measured time now excludes I/O

Step 0.3
--------

At the beginning, all code is not yet compiled => time measured is not representative of the best performance
=> Add a warmup step
+ Also avoid loading data twice

-> profile03
